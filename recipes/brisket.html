    <h2>Brisket done right!</h2>
    <p>Texas is known for its rub-style bbq, and nothing represents that more than Texas-style brisket - a thick bark of salt and pepper with a masterful smoke flavor</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Brisket flat or full packer brisket</li>
        <li>Coarse ground pepper (or fresh-cracked)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt (larger grain works best)</li>
        <li>Binder (mustard, worcestershire sauce, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim brisket, removing any silverskin and large fat deposits. Trim fatcap to 1/4 inch</li>
        <li>Apply binder liberally to brisket</li>
        <li>Thickly coat brisket with 50/50 salt and pepper mix</li>
        <li>Allow brisket to rest and rise to room temp while in this rub mixture</li>
        <li>Depending on personal time, set smoker to cook as low and slow as you safely can (I prefer 225, others 275 to cook faster</li>
        <li>Put brisket on smoker</li>
        <li>Monitor temp, when the "stall" is reached (155-175, noticeable slowdown in temperature gains) then remove brisket and wrap in pink butcher paper.</li>
        <li>You can add things to the wrap, but I do not. The brisket goes back on the smoker fully wrapped</li>
        <li>Monitor until brisket reaches 203+ degrees and is probe tender (sticking your temperature probe in should feel like putting a toothpick into warm butter)</li>
    </ol>
