    <h2>The best smoked queso you'll ever eat!</h2>
    <p>Original recipe from <a href="https://www.meatchurch.com/blogs/recipes/smoked-queso" target="new">Meat Church BBQ</a>. During the pandemic we started focusing on easy recipes largely made of items you may already have in your pantry. I asked Doug if we could shoot a video on his recipe. He gave us permission and the next month the internet and social media exploded with queso photos. This stuff is a hit! </p>
    <p>One note - since we are using Velveeta, we need to add a creamy soup for cheese consistency. We've been getting a lot of question on that one. Of course you can sub all the ingredients. You can use other cheese, coups and make your own Pico de Gallo instead of the Rotel, but again, this was supposed to be an easy one. We hope you enjoy!</p>
